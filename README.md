# Crawling-battle-spirit-card-game-picture
in this project, my python code will download all the picture of each set you want from https://battle-spirits.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Sets, 
Command the "scrapy crawl card_sets_spider -o card_url.json" in the battlespiritscraper folder will crawl all the image url and name of the card into card_url.json in the same folder. 
Run the download_image.py, it will ask what sets card do you want, enter like "BS10" and all the picture will be save to the path you want. 
CB04 in the github folder is the example ^^.
